Answer:

Android icons require five separate sizes for different screen pixel densities. Icons for lower resolution are created automatically from the baseline.

Launcher icons (.Png)

48 × 48 (mdpi) [baseline]
72 × 72 (hdpi)
96 × 96 (xhdpi)
144 × 144 (xxhdpi)
192 × 192 (xxxhdpi)
512 × 512 (Google Play store)





Handle round icons:
In AndroidManifest.xml, change
android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
to:
android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
