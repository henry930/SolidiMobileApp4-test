# Wait for app to load
- waitForAnimationToEnd:
    timeout: 5000

# Check if already logged in
- runFlow:
    when:
      visible: "Secure Login"
    commands:
      - runFlow: accurate_login_flow.yaml

# Wait for main screen
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Navigate to Assets page
- tapOn: "Assets"
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# Verify multiple assets are visible
- assertVisible: "Bitcoin"
- assertVisible: "Ethereum"
- assertVisible: "Litecoin"
- assertVisible: "Ripple"

# Verify prices are visible (checking for the currency symbol £)
# We can't check exact prices, but we can check that price elements exist
# Assuming the price is displayed near the asset name

# Take a screenshot to visually confirm prices for all assets
