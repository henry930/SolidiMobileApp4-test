# Verifies that transaction history and orders support infinite scroll

- launchApp

# Wait for app to load
- waitForAnimationToEnd:
    timeout: 5000

# Navigate to History/Orders page
# Assuming "History" or "Orders" is accessible from the main navigation or wallet
# Based on code, it seems to be a component in MainPanel, possibly "History" tab
- tapOn:
    id: "footer-btn-Wallet"
- tapOn:
    id: "footer-btn-History"

# Verify page loaded (check for common elements)
- assertVisible: "History"

# Check Transactions tab (default)
# Just try to scroll, if it fails it fails
- scrollUntilVisible:
    element:
      text: "Loading more..."
    direction: DOWN
    timeout: 5000
    visibilityPercentage: 100
    centerElement: true

# Switch to Orders tab

- scrollUntilVisible:
    element:
      text: "Loading more..."
    direction: DOWN
